        <div class="Secondpara">
            <p>A newbie to User Experince and User Interfaces, I always had a thing for creative arts and design.
                I started out as a graphic designer creating logos and social media posts. I'm always venturing towards something new in the tech field, and came across UI/UX design.
                The idea of buuilding a software and all the challenges and the opportunities, really intruiged me to pursue UI/UX design as a career. 
                Passionate and always eager to learn new ideas and visions and stretch the boundaries of my skills.
